üìò Operational Research ‚Äì Lab Work & Optimization Techniques
This repository contains lab assignments, problem-solving approaches, and technical implementations related to Operational Research (OR). Through this project, I explored the core concepts of OR and strengthened my analytical and optimization skills by working on real-world inspired problems.

üîç Key Topics Covered:
Linear Programming (LPP)

Transportation and Assignment Problems

Simplex Method

Duality in Linear Programming

Integer Programming

Game Theory

Queueing Theory and Simulation

Decision Making under Uncertainty

‚öôÔ∏è What I Learned:
Formulating mathematical models for optimization

Applying OR techniques using tools like Python, Excel Solver, and C++

Solving complex decision-making problems efficiently

Enhancing critical thinking for industrial and business applications

üí° Tech Stack:
Python (NumPy, SciPy)

C/C++

Jupyter Notebooks

Optimization libraries (PuLP, Google OR-Tools)

Would you like me to customize it more toward Python, C++, or the tools you specifically used?
